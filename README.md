Code used to answer [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.
There is not real idea behind this code, sometimes I go for the simple, brute force approach, sometimes I choose a more subtle approach.
Only constraint I chose is to use plain Java (currently 17), no third party except for Junit.

Stuff that comes back is extracted into utils.
