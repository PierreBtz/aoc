This project contains a small "framework" to ease my life when solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.
It also contains my solutions.
There is no real idea behind this code, sometimes I go for the simple, brute force approach, sometimes I choose a more subtle approach.
Only constraint I chose to resolve the puzzles is to use plain Java (currently 21), no third party except for Junit.

## Original Java version used per year:

* 2020: 11
* 2021: 17
* 2023: 21
